# Tag Swapper Plugin

This plugin is currently in development.  DON'T USE IT YET please....

The Tag Swapper allows you to swap out the HTML tag element based upon the configured attribute and its value.  It queries the post database records, searches using `DomDocument`, swaps out any matching tags, and then saves the records back to the database.  Migrating an old database or needing a quick way to replace out HTML, ok, here it is.
