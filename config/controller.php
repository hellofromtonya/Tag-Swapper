<p><span class="drop">T</span>his outfit ought to have a name, I thought. "This outfit" being I and all the enablers, aiders and abettors who are complicit in the development of this web site. So, I came up with "The Cliffside Historical Bunch." Has a certain dignity to it, don't you think? Yet it doesn't sound so official that someone will go running off to Raleigh or Washington to check our tax status.</p>
<p>I was tempted to call it "The Cliffside Historical Bunch and Marching Band," but that would require members to have certain musical talents; and if you've checked the cost of band uniforms lately, you know they're outrageous. Not to mention that some of us would find marching and playing an instrument, while coping with our walkers and oxygen tanks, a bit much.</p>
<p>Anyway, our mission statement (I wrote it myself) is clear and concise: Remember Cliffside!</p>
